**Cuei Core 🧠** <br>
Cuei Core is the engine behind Cuei — the brains that power the vibe coding experience.<br><br>

Inspired by the phrase "to give a cue", Cuei translates your intentions into automated workflows and code.
While Cuei App provides the user interface, Cuei Core handles all the heavy lifting under the hood.<br><br>


*🔍 What is Cuei Core?*<br>
Cuei Core is a backend service that:<br>

Interprets user prompts from Cuei App<br>

Generates code (Python, LangChain, and custom integrations)<br>

Orchestrates workflows and connects to third-party APIs<br>

Handles prompt engineering, AI model interactions (like GPT), and logic sequencing<br>

Outputs deployable workflows that integrate into real-world systems<br>

Cuei Core operates as a standalone service in its own repository, built to integrate seamlessly with Cuei App.<br><br>


*🏗️ How It Works*<br>
Cuei App sends user input (the "cue") to Cuei Core.<br>

Cuei Core processes the input:<br>

Analyzes intent<br>

Uses prompt engineering to structure requests<br>

Interacts with LLMs (e.g., GPT-4)<br>

Generates code, logic flows, or integration steps<br>

Returns structured outputs (code, configurations) back to Cuei App for user review and deployment.<br><br>


*🧩 Key Components*
Prompt Processing Engine
Refines user inputs and transforms them into model-ready prompts.<br>

Code Generation Module
Generates Python, LangChain, and custom logic scripts for workflows.<br>

Integration Layer
Connects with third-party tools (Airtable, APIs, Webhooks) to build end-to-end automations.<br>

Workflow Orchestrator
Sequences generated logic into coherent, executable workflows.<br><br>


*💻 Tech Stack*
Python<br>

LangChain<br>

OpenAI GPT models (or other LLMs)<br>

Custom Integration Scripts<br>

FastAPI (or your chosen framework) for handling API communication with Cuei App<br><br>


*🚀 Getting Started*<br>

1. Clone the repo:<br>

```
git clone https://github.com/your-org/cuei-core.git
cd cuei-core
```
<br>
2. Set up your environment:<br>

  - Recommended: use a virtual environment<br>
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
<br>
3. Configure environment variables:
  - Add your OpenAI API keys, integration secrets, etc.<br>

<!-- 4. Run the service: 

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
``` -->

<!-- 5. Test the API:
Use Cuei App or tools like Postman to send requests.


*🔄 Integration with Cuei App*
Cuei Core exposes API endpoints that Cuei App consumes.

Cuei App sends user prompts.

Cuei Core responds with generated code or workflows.

Both projects live in separate repositories for modular development.

*🎯 The Mission*
Cuei Core makes vibe coding possible —
transforming ideas into real code and automated processes, without the need for manual programming.<br><br>
